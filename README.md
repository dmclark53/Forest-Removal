# Forest-Removal
In this project I investigate the relationship between forest removal and
percent forest coverage for countries in the world. Forest removal is defined as
the total value in US dollars of all products removed during that year. Products
are both wood and non-wood related. All data is taken from the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) website.
